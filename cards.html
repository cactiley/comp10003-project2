                The original Exploding Kittens deck consists of 9 types of cards in total. This section explains the
                function of each card if a player draws or plays it.

                            This card can be played after drawing an Exploding Kitten card to cheat death. Place this
                            card in the discard pile after use. Then take the Exploding Kitten card (the one you
                            narrowly avoided) and secretly place it BACK into the DRAW pile ANYWHERE you’d like (yes, it
                            can be on top). Do this without viewing or reordering any other cards. Your turn ends after
                            playing this card.

                    <p>This card immediately ends your turn without drawing, and forces the next player to take two
                        turns in a row. That is, they’ll end up drawing 2 cards… unless they play another attack card.
                        In this case, the turns add up: the next player will take 4 turns, or the next might take 6…
                        This card is useful if you suspect that the next card is an Exploding Kitten.</p>

                        to an attack card, it only ends 1 out of 2 turns. 2 Skip cards can be played to fully cancel an

                        immediately before a nope card is cancelled, and a Nope card can be played at ANY time – even if
                        it isn’t your turn. Nope cards can also be stacked onto Nope cards to cancel the Nope.</p>
