        <p>The HTML and CSS used in this project was considered at length to ensure an engaging, accessible and user friendly website. HTML tags such as header, nav, main and section were used to give our site clear structure, making it easy for users to navigate through and understand the content. The Navigation bar uses the nav element to allow users to access key pages like "quiz" and "cards" readily, supporting useability. 
           The Site uses three fonts, Bebas Neue for bold headings; Figtree for clean and readable body text; and Alegreya for stylistic subheadings. These fonts work together to create a playful feel, well suited for the game that we chose. Layouts are managed using a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid, applied through .flex-container and .grid-container classes, allowing the content to be well-structured and responsive across different screen sizes. Cards are displayed using the card and card2 classes, keeping images and text boxes consistent and balanced across the website, with padding and styling. To assist users in easily distinguishing between different types of content, background colors are grouped by section using classes like .subsection1 and .subsection2.
