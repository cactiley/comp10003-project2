                    Headings are used to create titles and subtitles across the webpage. The headings range from
                    <span class="monospace">&lt;h1&gt;</span> to <span class="monospace">&lt;h4&gt;</span> to format and
                    divide the sections depending on the content. For example, the
                    <span class="monospace">&lt;h1&gt;</span> heading 'Exploding Kittens' included in the
                    <span class="monospace"> &lt;header&gt;</span> signifies that it is the main title displayed
                    across all web pages. This creates emphasis and lets viewers know that the main content covered is
                    about Exploding Kittens.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paragraphs <span class="monospace">&lt;p&gt;</span> are used to write descriptive text that goes
                    below the heading. This includes content extending on the heading and explanations to provide
                    further knowledge for viewers.

                    Images were embedded through the <span class="monospace">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag to provide graphics
                    relating to the content of the
                    web page. Images also enhance the appearance of the webpage to attract viewers. This goes for the
                    GIF banner in the header consisting of a kitten with animated special effects. The <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag
                    also contains two important attributes: <span class="monospace">&lt;src&gt;</span> and <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;alt&gt;</span>.
                    The <span class="monospace">&lt;src&gt;</span> attribute
                    retrieves and links to the location of the image. The <span class="monospace">&lt;alt&gt;</span>
                    attribute is an alternate
                    description of the image, specifically for screen readers. This provides accessibility for users
                    with vision impairment.

                    This website uses a combination of official graphics (images of cards and branding images from the
                    Exploding Kittens official website), as well as hand-drawn images and collages. These complement
                    text to better express points; for example, images of specific cards accompany their explanations,
                    and diagrams of the setup follow the instructions.

                    Semantic containers divided webpages based on their function. The <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;header&gt;</span> container,
                    containing <span class="monospace">&lt;nav&gt;</span>, was kept uniform across pages. This allows
                    fast, user-friendly navigation
                    and a clear indication of the website's name and purpose. The <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;main&gt;</span> element of the webpage is
                    divided into sections (using <span class="monospace">&lt;section&gt;</span>) for clarity; topics and
                    ideas are grouped visually.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Class selectors were used in <span class="monopsace">&lt;section&gt;</span> containers for CSS
                    styling. The <span class="monospace">&lt;div&gt;</span> container
                    was also used to create components within sections visually distinctive. This allows large sections
                    of text to be categorised for better readability.

                    Anchors (using <span class="monospace">&lt;a&gt;</span>) were added to direct users to external
                    sites where references were
                    provided. Use of links, rather than a text reference of another site's web address, allows users to
                    go directly to another website, rather than having to manually reach the site.

                    The website's colour palette evokes a dull yet playful atmosphere. It contains a balance of
                    monochromatic greys with a pop of red seen in the
                    <span class="monospace">&lt;nav&gt;</span>nav> bar. The color <span class="monospace">#5B6464</span>
                    is
                    achieved through the property <span class="monospace">background-color</span> of the <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;body&gt;</span> and
                    <span class="monospace">#591C14</span> through the same property of the <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;nav&gt;</span>. The background colour also differs from the
                    subsections and cards to create a division between the background and the written text.

                    classes for styling. This
                    ensures that specific elements differ from one another to create a balanced layout. The <span

                    class is an example of a selector containing properties such as <span class="monospace">display:

                        column</span>, allowing multiples cards to stack on top of each other.

                    Fonts helps to categorise different forms of text based on the content to display on the web page.

                    uses the <span class="monospace">font-family: "Bebas Neue"</span> to emphasise the main title
                    across all web pages. Headings <span class="monospace">&lt;h3&gt;</span> and <span
                        class="monospace">&lt;h4&gt;</span> uses the <span class="monospace">font-family:
                        "Alegreya"</span>
                    as titles for subsections and cards.

                <p>Font families ensure a fallback option are available in case a user's browser does not support our

                    Images were styled into different sizes depending on its context varied across the web pages. Sizes
                    are distinguished by the properties <span class="monospace">width</span> to set the image in a
                    specific length, and <span class="monospace">padding</span> to
                    create space around the image. This allows for a cleaner and consistent layout which appears more
                    pleasant towards the viewers.

                <p>Images were all kept less than 100 KB. Compressing images allows the website to run smoothly. This
                    was done by reducing the dimensions and converting file types; PNG images were converted to WEBP or

                    Containers were styled differently, using class selectors where needed, to visually separate areas.
                    This created distinct sections, primarily through colour choices and margins/padding.

                    store elements in a single row. While class <span class="monospace">grid-container</span> with <span
