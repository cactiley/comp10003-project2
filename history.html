                        <p>Elan lee conceptualises the idea to create a game that allows people to interact and engage with each other Him and his friend Shane Small create “bomb squad” a game with bomb cards that eventually explode. They approach Matthew Inman from “The Oatmeal” with their idea.</p>

                        <p>Matthew Inman loves the idea but worries that the subject of bombs might be too intense. Inman and Lee decide to centre the game around kittens instead! Together, they launch a crowdfunded Kickstarter campaign, with intent to gather enough funds to produce 10000 decks. On January 20th, Exploding Kittens was announced as a Kickstarter project.</p>
