                    <p>The aim of Exploding Kittens is to avoid drawing an “Exploding Kitten” card at all costs. Players
                        take turns drawing cards until all but 1 player is eliminated - by kittens that explode. The
                        deck is comprised of a selection of cards to help you navigate your way out of this fate - and
                        trap other players into a kitten-related demise. Other cards can strategically be played before
                        drawing, decreasing the chances of exploding.</p>

                        into the deck. Shuffle thoroughly (again). This means that when the bottom of the draw pile has
                        been reached, 1 player will remain.</p>
